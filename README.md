# Worlds-Hardest-Game
Developed a game where the user goes through an obstacle course. 
User controls the object through keyboard arrows and tries to avoid hitting another object.
The objective is to get to the checkpoint without hitting another object.
Incomplete: Need to add multiple levels where difficulty progresses and incorporate collision detector to end game.
